# Slashbot

Slashbot is a Discord bot using Disnake. It is designed to work in only a few
servers, so there are some hardcoded values here and there.

## Deployment

Slashbot is designed to be run using Docker. Slashbot requires multiple API
keys which should be put in the provided .env file.

Once you have configured your API keys, launch Slashbot using

```bash
docker compose up
```
